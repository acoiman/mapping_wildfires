# Title

Mapping VIIRS Active Fires in South America

We will demonstrate how to map VIIRS-AFs in any country in [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America). You only need to tweak the code below if you want to map AFs in countries located in other continents. We will mainly use [Geopanadas](https://geopandas.org/) for data processing and [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) for map visualization.
